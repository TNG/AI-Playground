// ── media capability ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The AIPG media tools (image/video/3D generation and editing, plus speech).
// Which tools exist is decided by the renderer and shipped with the turn as
// `toolSpecs`: one thin `media` delegation tool when tool delegation is on, else
// generateImage + editImage, and the speech tools the preset has enabled. Direct
// tools and the NL specialist's inner Comfy tools both execute in-process
// against the Artifact runner (steps 5 and 12); speech calls the engine through
// the window (mediaSpeech.ts). Screenshot / web-browse stay on the renderer
// bridge.
